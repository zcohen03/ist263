            <h1>Zach's Biography</h1>
            Zach Cohen
            <h2>Personal Info</h2>
            <p>My <strong>major</strong> is Information Management and Technology, with a concentration in digital retail strategies. I am really interested in doing work with a consulting firm, while I refuse to commit to wanting that as my future job, I always think it would be fun to work for a company that competes with my dad and hopefully I could one day compete against him on a project. </p>
            Accomplishments/skills:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>I am bilingual, I am fluent in Spanish and I received the biliteracy award in high school.</li>
                <li>I am an avid day camp counselor.</li>
                <li>I was tennis and cross-country captain in high school.</li>
                <li>I am very familiar with programs like adobe photoshop and video editing software like final cut pro.</li>
                </ul>
            Outside of work/school I enjoy following and playing many sports, but I love soccer above all else. I ski frequently in the winter and I really enjoy being with my friends that I’ve met at school through my fraternity, classes, or people I’ve met in other various ways. I love the show on Netflix called “I think you should leave with Tim Robinson”, I think it is the funniest anything to ever exist. Speaking of funny, one of my favorite pastimes is being able to make people laugh.<br>
