            My major is Information management and technology, with a concentration in digital retail strategies. I am really interested in doing work with a consulting firm, while I refuse to commit to wanting that as my future job, I always think it would be fun to work for a company that competes with my dad and hopefully I could one day compete against him on a project. 
            Accomplishments/skills:
            -bilingual, I am fluent in Spanish and I received the biliteracy award in high school
            -I am an avid day camp counselor
            -I was tennis and cross-country captain in high school
            -I am very familiar with programs like adobe photoshop and video editing software like final cut pro
            Outside of work/school I enjoy following and playing many sports, but I love soccer above all else. I ski frequently in the winter and I really enjoy being with my friends that I’ve met at school through my fraternity, classes, or people I’ve met in other various ways. I love the show on Netflix called “I think you should leave with Tim Robinson”, I think it is the funniest anything to ever exist. Speaking of funny, one of my favorite pastimes is being able to make people laugh.
